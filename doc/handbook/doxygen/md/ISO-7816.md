# Introduction of ISO-7816 protocol

ISO-7816, the International Standard for Smart Card Communication, specifies the specifications for contact smart cards, including physical characteristics, interface specifications, transmission protocols, command exchange formats, and so on.

Telink SoC integrates ISO-7816 communication module and supports communication with contact IC cards. This article briefly introduces the method to establish communication between Telink SoC and contact IC cards.

# How to use ISO-7816

## Hardware connection

![Hardware connection](pic/hardwareconnection.png "Hardware connection")

In actual use, we need to connect each contact of IC card to SoC one by one, which is the hardware basis for communication between SoC and IC card.

(1) VCC is the power supply voltage of IC card and RST is the reset signal of IC card. We can choose any two of the free GPIO pins of the SoC to connect to it.

(2) CLK is the clock contact of the IC card. The clock is supplied to the IC card by the SoC.

(3) TRX, I/O contact, is IC card input and output contact. Because IC card only supports half-duplex communication, at a certain moment I/O contact only supports input or output, so in actual use we need to pay attention to the timing.

**Note:**

> - The IS07816-3 protocol specifies three operating voltages for IC cards: Class A-5V, Class B-3V, and Class C-1.8V. In actual use, the voltage provided by the SoC needs to match the operating voltage of the card.

## Initilization

```C
s7816_set_pin(gpio_pin_e rst_pin,gpio_pin_e vcc_pin,gpio_pin_e clk_pin,gpio_pin_e trx_pin)
s7816_init(uart_num_e uart_num,s7816_clock_e clock,int f,int d)
```

s7816_set_pin() is used to configure the RST,VCC,CLK,TRX pins.

S7816_init() is used to select UART channels (UART0 and UART1), configure IC card clock, and IC card clock frequency adjustment factor F (default is 372) and bit rate adjustment factor D (default is 1).

```C
s7816_en(uart_num_e chn)
```

After the configuration is complete, you need to use the function s7816_en() to enable the 7816 module.

**Note:**

> - The S7816 is implemented through the UART function of the SoC, so it will occupy the corresponding UART module when used.

## IC card activation and cold reset

```C
s7816_coldreset();
```

The ISO7816 protocol states that after the reset pin is pulled up, the cold reset answer will begin within 400-40,000 clock cycles thereafter.

![Cold reset](pic/coldreset.png "Cold reset")

Taking the SoC clock configuration of 4MHz as an example, the cold reset process is as follows:

a) After VCC is pulled up, the SoC outputs CLK from the Ta moment, the SoC configures the TRX pin, and after the SoC's TRX pin is configured, the SoC's TRX pin is set to the receive state.

b) Within 40,000 cycles (10,000us) after Ta, RST is pulled up.

c) Within 40,000 cycles (10,000us) after RST is pulled high, the IC card will pass back the reset character to the SoC.

```C
s7816_set_time(int rst_time_us)
```

s7816_set_time() is used to reset the s7816_rst_time time in a cold reset.

(1) rst_time_us corresponds to s7816_rst_time, which is the reset waiting time from Ta to Tb in the timing sequence, and the default is 40,000 clock cycles.

(2) s7816_atr_time, the time to wait for the ATR return time after Tb in the timing sequence, ranges from 400 to 40,000 clock cycles. In practice, you need to wait for the ATR character to be received before proceeding to the next operation (you can perform protocol parsing in the main function to determine whether the ATR character is received).

## Warm reset

```C
s7816_warmreset()
```

![Warm reset](pic/warmreset.png "Warm reset")

The IC card has specified specifications and contents for the reset answer to the terminal. If the answer to reset received by the interrupt does not meet the specified requirements, the terminal will initiate a warm reset and obtain a reset signal from the IC card.

Take the clock configuration 4MHz as an example, the warm reset process is as follows:

a) CLK and VCC always remain normal state (CLK applied, VCC pulled up).

b) At the moment of Tc, set RST from high to low.

c) Within 200 cycles (50us) of the Tc moment, the SoC sets the TRX pin to the receiving state.

d) Set RST high within 40,000 cycles (10000-10000us) after Tc. The IC card answer to reset will start within 40,000 cycles (10000us) after Td.

Like the cold reset, the warm reset can also reset the s7816_rst_time (default value 40,000 clock cycles) using the s7816_set_time() function. You need to wait for the ATR character to be received before you can proceed to the next step.

**Note:**

> - The answer to reset (initial ATR) is the same for cold reset and warm reset. The difference between the two is that cold reset is accompanied by IC card activation and warm reset is performed after IC card activation.

## Contact release

```C
s7816_release_trig()
```

![Contact release](pic/contactrelease.png "Contact release")

During cold reset or warm reset, if the IC card does not respond to the reset within the specified time, the terminal needs to initiate a contact release timing sequence.

(1) The terminal starts the contact release sequence by setting RST to low level.

(2) After setting RST low and before VCC is powered down, the terminal sets CLK and I/O low as well.

(3) Finally, the terminal power down VCC before actually breaking the contact.

# Demo introduction

Take an initialized SMARTCOS-PSAM card as an example. The demo first performs a cold reset and then takes random numbers.

Take random command is: 0x00,0x84,0x00,0x00,0x04 (take 4 bytes of random number)

Cold reset to obtain initial ATR:

![Cold reset to obtain initial ATR](pic/coldresettoobtainatr.png "Cold reset to obtain initial ATR")

The initial ATR is 16 bytes in total. The initial ATR is analyzed as follows:

(1) 3B: positive agreement.

(2) 6C: that is, T0, binary of 6 is 0110, indicating the presence of TB1 and TC1, C indicates that the historical characters is 12.

(3) From T0, we know that TB1 is 00, which means no additional programming voltage is required.

(4) It is known from T0 that TC1 is 02 and two additional protection times are required, that is, two additional etu times are required between every two bytes when sending data from the terminal to the IC card.

(5) From T0, we know that the 12 historical characters are 0x58,0x02,0x86,0x38,0x50,0x53,0x41,0x4d,0x80,0x00,0x83,0x73.

(6) The IC card uses the T=0 protocol and has no TCK check character.

Taking random numbers is as follows:

![Taking random numbers](pic/takingrandomnumbers.png "Taking random numbers")

Where 0x00,0x84,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x04 are the commands sent by the terminal to the IC card to take random numbers.

The random numbers obtained are 0xf0,0x44,0xef,0x7f for a total of 4 bytes, and the random numbers taken will be different each time.

Data ending with 9000 indicates successful execution of the command.
