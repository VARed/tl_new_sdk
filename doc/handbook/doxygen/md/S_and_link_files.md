# Use of combinations

According to different usage scenarios, we can choose the corresponding combination.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage scenario                                                          S file                         link file
----------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------ ---------------------------------
Common boot from flash                                                  cstartup_b91_flash.S           flash_boot.link

Used when testing performance (coremark and                             cstartup_b91_flash.S           flash_boot_ramcode.link
dhrystone)

Used to load to ram to start the program, cannot                        cstartup_b91_ram.S             ram_boot.link  
be loadedto the flash for execution

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The differences in the S files therein are as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
S file                   Description
------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------
cstartup_b91_flash.S     It is the S file required to start the program from flash.

cstartup_b91_ram.S       It is the S file required to start the program  from ram.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The differences in link files are as follows:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
link file                        Description
-------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
flash_boot.link                  Used in normal usage scenarios.

flash_boot_ramcode.link          The only difference with the flash_boot.link file is that it puts all the segments except the vector segment needed for booting into the ramcode segment, and all the programs run in ram, which makes the execution time fast.

ram_boot.link                    This file is used to load to ram to start the program, cannot be loaded to flash for execution. This link file works with cstartup_b91_ram.S file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Configuration method

## Link

You can select the link file to be used by the following configuration.

![link file configuration](pic/linkfileconfiguration.png "link file configuration")

## S file

S files are selected differently by the following macro definitions.

![Macro definitions for distinguishing S files](pic/macrodefinitionsfordistinguishingSfiles.png "Macro definitions for distinguishing S files")

Macros can be defined in the following way to decide which S file to choose to use.

![Selecting macro definitions for S files](pic/selectingmacrodefinitionsforSfiles.png "Selecting macro definitions for S files")

## objdump.txt

The relevant distributions of VMA and LMA can be seen in the generated objdump.txt file.

The following figure shows an objdump.txt file generated by compiling with cstartup_b91_flash.S and flash_boot.link file.

In this file, the VMA and LMA addresses of vectors and text are the same, and these two segments are taken from the flash for execution.

![The VMA and LAMA addresses of vectors and text](pic/thevmaandlamaaddressesofvectorsandtext.png "The VMA and LAMA addresses of vectors and text")

The VMA and LMA addresses of retention_reset, retention_data, and ram_code are different. The LMA address is the flash address, and the VMA address is the IRAM address. In the S file, it will move these three segments from the flash to the IRAM correspondingly.

![VMA and LMA addresses of retention_reset, retention_data, and ram_code](pic/vmaandlmaaddressesofretentionresetretentiondataandramcode.png "VMA and LMA addresses of retention_reset, retention_data, and ram_code")

The addresses of VMA and LMA of data segment are different, the address of LMA is in flash and the address of VMA is in DRAM.

In the S file, the data segment will be moved from flash to DRAM correspondingly.

    NDS_SAG_LMA_FLASH = 0x20000000 ;

//keep is equivalent to telling the compiler that this section should not be garbage collected. The garbage collection is to remove unused sections and not output to the output file, set with the --gc-sections option. But you can use KEEP to keep it.

## Alignment

The link file involves some alignment rules. If it involves multiple segments moved together, you need to pay attention to the alignment of these segments. When the starting address of LMA and VMA are not consistent, multiple segments moving together is likely to encounter move error.

The following is an example of an error:

The code in the S file is trying to move the sdata and data segments from the LMA to the VMA. The starting address of the VMA is 0x00080000 and the starting address of the LMA is related to the previous code and is aligned according to the alignment rules of the VMA for sdata.

![Example of error in link file alignment rules](pic/exampleoferrorinlinkfilealignmentrules.png "Example of error in link file alignment rules")

The following figure shows an error-prone lst file compiled with the above link file.

![The lst file with error](pic/thelstfilewitherror.png "The lst file with error")

There are several methods of modification:

(1) Move one segment at a time so that you don't have the problems above.

(2) Merge sdata, data segments.

## Differences between vectors and retention_reset segments

The retention_reset is the startup code that will run when comes back from retention.

The current retention_reset processing is not to move these segments (retention_reset, retention_data, ram_code) from flash to ram, because these segments are retained during the retention phase and will not be lost. The condition for this processing is that the size of the retention ram is larger than these segments, and if there is more than that, then the move action needs to be done.

The retention_reset boot part requires more processing than the vectors, include: flash wake-up, multi-address register recovery. which is a must-do processing coming from the retention.

## Others

### Notes on the use of .org

In the current compilation environment, .org and Link Time Optimization (-flto) in the optimization option cannot be used at the same time. However, (-flto) is definitely selected in order to compile a small bin file, so if you want to use .org in the S file, you need to use it as follows:

![The Link TimeOptimization (-flto) in optimization options](pic/thelinktimeoptimizationinoptimizationoptions.png "The Link TimeOptimization (-flto) in optimization options")

```C
.option push       //push saves the current .option configuration
.option norelax   // set to norelax
.org 0x0         //set .org
.........
.option pop     // Use pop to restore the .option configuration
```

The description of .option is as follows:

The .option pseudo-command is used to set certain architecture-specific options that enable the assembler to recognize the option and act according to the definition of the option.

The push, pop are used to temporarily save or restore the options specified by the .option pseudo-command:

The ".option push" pseudo-command temporarily saves the current option settings, allowing new options to be specified later using the .option pseudo-command, while the ".option pop" pseudo-command restores the most recently saved option settings to take effect again.

The combination of ".option push" and ".option pop" makes it possible to set different options specifically for a section of code embedded in an assembly program without affecting the global option settings.

### Compression command

The RISC-V's C Extension, which refers to replacing 32bit commands with 16bit commands, and Andes' CoDense (Code Dense) technology puts 32bit commands inside the command table and replaces them with 16 EXEC.IT 0xxxxx where the original 32bit commands appear.

The macro \__nds_execit is set to be on by compiler default, while \_ITB_BASE_ will be set to the first address of .exec.itable.

Set _ITB_BASE_ to register uitb in the S file as the base address of the command table. The compression instructions are put into the .exec.itable segment.

### FPU enable

The macro \__riscv_flen is set to be on by compiler default.

Before executing a floating-point command, the mstatus<14:13> FS segment needs to be changed to a non-zero value, otherwise a command exception will occur. So the S file sets FS to 0b11 and initializes the floating-point control status register FCSR to 0.
